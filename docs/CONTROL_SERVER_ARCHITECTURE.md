# Control Server Architecture

The Flask app at `control-server/app.py` runs as `lighting-control.service` on
the Pi and serves both the live UI and a JSON API at port `5000`. It sits
between user input (browser, voice, AI chat) and QLC+'s WebSocket on port
`9999`.

## Why a Single Persistent WebSocket

QLC+ 4.14.x has a hard cap (~50) on simultaneous WebSocket clients. Earlier
versions of this server opened a new connection for every send and called
`transport.abort()` to close it. That works for a few requests, then breaks.

The reason: `transport.abort()` discards the connection without sending a
TCP `FIN`. When QLC+ closes its end of the connection, the local socket sits
in `CLOSE_WAIT` until Python's garbage collector eventually runs the socket's
`__del__`. Under load, sockets accumulate in `CLOSE_WAIT` faster than they
clean up, and once we hit 50 the QLC+ accept queue fills, every new handshake
silently times out, and "Failed to apply scene via WebSocket" errors begin.

The current architecture avoids this entirely: **one WebSocket, opened once,
held for the lifetime of the process**. Reconnection happens lazily only when
the existing connection is verifiably dead (the reader task exited).

### Implementation Details

- A daemon thread runs `_qlc_loop`, a dedicated `asyncio` event loop. The
  WebSocket lives on this loop because `websockets.WebSocketClientProtocol`
  is bound to whichever loop created it.
- `_qlc_ws` is the global connection reference, guarded by `_qlc_ws_lock`.
- `_ensure_qlc_ws()` opens the connection if missing or closed. Before
  opening a fresh one it explicitly `await ws.close()`s the old one (with a
  1s timeout) so the underlying TCP socket is properly torn down.
- `_qlc_reader(ws)` continuously drains incoming messages. When QLC+ sends an
  unsolicited `getChannelsValues` reply, the reader matches it against any
  pending request waiting via `_qlc_pending_responses`. When the reader exits
  (connection drop, error), it explicitly closes the socket and clears
  `_qlc_ws` so the next caller reconnects.
- Flask request handlers call `_qlc_run(coro, timeout=N)` to dispatch
  coroutines onto the QLC+ loop. Internally that uses
  `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
- `set_channel_values()`, `_fade_brightness_async()`, and
  `_fetch_channel_values()` all share the same persistent connection,
  serialized by the lock.

### Health Reporting

`GET /api/status` reports `qlc_ws.ok = True` only when the persistent
WebSocket is currently open. It does **not** open a fresh TCP probe — under
load QLC+ may not accept new TCP connections within a tight timeout even
though the existing WebSocket is functioning fine.

## Fixture Definition Parsing

`control-server/fixture_definitions.py` reads `.qxf` files from
`/usr/share/qlcplus/fixtures/` and `~/.qlcplus/fixtures/` and resolves a
**semantic role** for each channel. The role lookup precedence is:

1. `<Channel Preset="...">` attribute (e.g. `IntensityRed`, `IntensityAmber`,
   `IntensityMasterDimmer`, `ColourMacro`, `ShutterStrobeSlowFast`).
2. `<Colour>` subtag (e.g. `White` is split into `warm` / `cool` based on
   the channel name; `Amber` → `amber`; `UV` → `uv`).
3. Exact channel name match (e.g. `Master Dimmer`, `Warm White`).
4. Group-based classification (`Intensity` → `dimmer`, `Shutter` → `strobe`,
   `Colour` → `macro`).
5. Fuzzy substring match — only applied for `Intensity`-group channels and
   channels with no explicit group, to avoid falsely matching configuration
   knobs (Speed, Maintenance, Effect groups always return `None`).

The result is a list of `FixtureChannel` objects per `FixtureMode`, each with
`offset`, `name`, `preset`, `group`, `colour`, and `role`.

### How the Control Server Uses Roles

- `_fixture_roles(fixture)` maps role names to channel offsets:
  `{"dimmer": 0, "warm": 1, "cool": 2, "amber": 3, "brightness": [0]}`.
- `apply_color_live()` writes color preset values for matching color roles
  and explicitly zeros every other channel that isn't a color/dimmer/motion
  channel — so leftover macro/strobe/program state from a previous scene
  never bleeds into the new one.
- `fade_brightness_live()` operates only on the offsets in
  `roles["brightness"]` (the dedicated dimmer when present, otherwise all
  RGB-ish channels).

### How AI Scene Generation Uses Roles

`scripts/lib/extract_fixtures.py` invokes the same parser to emit enriched
JSON for the AI prompt. Each fixture in the prompt now includes its full
`channel_info` array — name, role, preset, group, colour, and absolute DMX
channel number. The system prompt in `scripts/lib/ai_scene.sh` instructs the
LLM to:

- Pick channels by **role**, not by guessing offsets
- Never write to channels with `role: null` (configuration knobs)
- Mix warm/cool/amber on fixtures that lack RGB (e.g. SlimPAR Pro W)
- Set `macro` and `strobe` to 0 for static colored scenes

This is what stopped the AI from accidentally triggering the strobe channel
on the SlimPAR Pro W when asked for "soft warm light".

### `/api/action` vs `/api/command`

Both routes ultimately call `execute_lighting_action`. The difference is the
front end:

- `/api/command` accepts free-form text, runs it through the AI interpreter
  (OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama), and dispatches the resulting action. Used by
  the web UI's chat input.
- `/api/action` accepts a structured `{action, parameters, groups}` payload
  and dispatches directly. Used by the **MCP server** at `:5001/mcp`, where an
  LLM agent is already on the other end of the connection — calling
  `/api/command` would double-LLM.

Schema for `POST /api/action`:

```json
{
  "action": "adjust_color",
  "parameters": { "color": "warm", "intensity": "75%" },
  "groups": ["key-lights"]
}
```

Valid actions match `execute_lighting_action`'s dispatcher: `apply_template`,
`generate_scene`, `adjust_brightness`, `adjust_color`, `color_temperature`,
`palette`, `strobe`, `fade`, `activate_scene`.

> **Note**: `palette` ignores the top-level `groups` argument — its
> assignments dict's keys *are* the targets.

## Failure Modes & Recovery

- **QLC+ wedged after a previous bad version leaked sockets**: restart QLC+
  with `./lightsctl.sh restart`. The control server will reconnect on the
  next request.
- **Control server can't open the initial WebSocket**: it prints
  `✗ QLC+ WebSocket connect failed: ...` and continues. The next API call
  triggers a lazy retry.
- **Connection drops mid-session**: the reader task exits, explicitly closes
  the socket, and clears `_qlc_ws`. The next request reopens.
- **AI prompt times out**: OpenAI/Anthropic latency dominates total request
  time (1-20s typical). `execute_ms` in the `/api/command` response shows
  pure DMX time; subtract from `total_ms` for AI inference time.
